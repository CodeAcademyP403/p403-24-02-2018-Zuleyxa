        Responsive Layouts Without Bootstrap
    </h1>

    <div class=center>
       <p> This is a simple demonstration of organizing different elements without bootstrap so that when a browser is resized the elements adjust accordingly.The goal isobviously to be completely functional with as simple coding as possible.This means avoiding media queries when possible etc.Maybe this is common knowledge for must but as I`m growing and learning.I haven`t found a comprehensive tutorial on the web with this stuff.SO..here`s my two cents.</p>

    <h2>Working with Inline Block

    </h2>
    <div class=center>
        <p>Let`s say you have a group of objects that are all similar in size and shape.A common scenario would be if you had multiple images or icons that you are setting side by side in a row.In our case,we`ll use boxes.The easiest set-up is to set them in a parent container with text-align:center,to center them and then give each element a display:inline or inline-block.FYI,you do have to declare a widht in order for this to work.Just keeping in real.</p>
